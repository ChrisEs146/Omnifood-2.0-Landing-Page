## Omnifood 2.0

This is a landing page created for an hypothetical company called Omnifood. The landing page main goal is to collect user information (Name, Email) to create a email list.

**Tools used in this project:** HTML, SCSS, Parcel, JavaScript and the [Formspree platform](https://formspree.io/).

**Features**

- HTML markup was organized using the BEM naming convention.
- Mobile Menu has an animation to show up and hide when the users clicks the hamburger menu at the top-tight corner. It also contains icons to provide visual help.
- The entire navigation has a sticky behavior after the user crosses the hero section.
- On large screen, the **How To** section will incorporate a tab component to show each step.
- Several section in the landing page were created using, either, flex or grid layouts to improve responsiveness and avoid media queries as much as possible.
- The contact form is completely functional and will send the information to a registered email in the **Formspree platform**. Here is the final result for a user whose name is **Arthur Swanson**, with an email **arthur@email.com** and a selection of **Facebook**.
