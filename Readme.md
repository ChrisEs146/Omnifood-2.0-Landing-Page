## Omnifood 2.0

This is an upgraded version of the omnifood landing page I created a while a go. In this version I'm planning to change the following things:

- Upgrade the HTML markup to stick with the BEM convention.
- Rewrite all the styles with SCSS.
- Upgrade the mobile menu, adding icons and new animations.
- Animate the Featured section.
- Implement a tab component instead of the "How To" section.
- Improve the grid layout in the testimonials section.
- Add functionality to the contact form. Either by sending the information to an e-mail or a platform like MailChimp.
- Add reCaptcha to the contact form.
